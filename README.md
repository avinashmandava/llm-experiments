Place to store learning projects as I play with langchain and other LLM tools.

Each project is it's own folder. They have their own READMEs, you can look at the to learn more.

Most of these are going to just be POCs, they're for me to learn not really meant to be supported/released. If you like any of the concepts let me know I'll try to put more time into finishing any that seem useful.
